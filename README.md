# TidyLing

TidyLing is an online resource for linguists. It takes linguistics papers in Latex, Word, or PDF format and returns a csv file in what we call TidyLing format with the linguistic examples in the paper.

In a tidy dataset, each observation is a row and each variable in a column ([Wickham 2014](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)). Tidy data sets are easy to manipulate, model, and visualize.

## TidyLing data

Tidy linguistic data (tidyling data) is a tidy dataset for linguistic examples. In TidyLing datasets each linguistic example occupies a row and the columns are the variables of interest to linguists such as the transliteration, the gloss, the translation, and the judgement. The table below shows an example tidyling dataset.

| Judgement | Transliteration | Gloss | Translation | Language | Context | Source | document name | notes | 
|------|---------|-------------|-----|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| # | Colorless green ideas sleep furuously| | | English | | Chomsky (1957) | chomskynoam1957.tex | |
| ? | Amir raft xune | Amir went home | Amire went home | Farsi | | Jasbi (2017) | jasbi2017.tex | this is a made up example |
| # | man xoshhalam| 1SG happy-1SG | I am happy | Farsi | Writing a linguistics paper| Jasbi (2017) | jasbi2017.tex | |


# Database of Linguistics Examples

A large part of linguistics research relies on natives speaker judgments as primary empirical data. However, the valuable natives speaker judgments are often hard to access and search.
