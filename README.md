TidyLinguist is an online software for linguists that takes linguistics papers in Latex, Word, or PDF format and returns a csv file with the data in the paper in what we call TidyLing format.

TidyLing is a tidy data set (Wickham 2014) for linguistics examples. In a tidy dataset, each observation is a row and each variable in a column.
