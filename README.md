# TidyLing

TidyLinguist is an online resource for linguists. It takes linguistics papers in Latex, Word, or PDF format and returns a csv file in what we call TidyLing format with the linguistic examples in the paper.

## TidyLing Format

In a tidyling format each example in the paper or document occupies a row



TidyLing is a tidy data set for linguistics examples. In a tidy dataset, each observation is a row and each variable in a column ([Wickham 2014](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)).

# Database of Linguistics Examples

A large part of linguistics research relies on natives speaker judgments as primary empirical data. However, the valuable natives speaker judgments are often hard to access and search.
